# Solo Agreement

This assignment was initially done as a group. However, being on the self-paced track I am working as a solo developer. Here is a link where I asked ChatGPT to modify the questions to better fit a solo developer. [Link](https://chat.openai.com/share/2720c6b4-c2e7-464a-95f5-dc04912f20a3)

## Cooperation Plan (Solo Developer)

### Self-assessment

* Identify your key strengths as a developer.
* Consider how to best utilize these strengths in the project execution.

My key strengths are mindset and drive. I usually do a pretty good job of getting things going and being able to complete a project I am genuinely excited about. So to ensure I am able to make the most of these qualities is to make sure the project is something I care about.

### Professional Growth

* Reflect on the competencies you want to further develop.
* Plan how you will focus on enhancing these skills throughout the project.

So one of the competencies I have is knowing how the business world works, and that includes things like this agreement and level of preparation for a project. I'm not familiar with these methods, but the more time I take to make sure I take my time and give it my best effort the better I will be able to work with a real team with a project that requires cooperation and planning.

### Day-to-Day Approach

* Outline your daily work routine.
* Ensure you're not dominating the project individually but embracing diverse ideas.

So my daily work routine various due to other priorities like my private practice, teaching workshops, and yoga classes. However, whenever I am not doing that my ideal schedule is:

* Wake up 5-6 am
* Breakfast 6-7 am
* Work 7-9:30 am
* Walk/Workout 9:30 - 11 am
* Lunch 11-12 pm
* Work 12-3 pm
* Walk/Break 3-4 pm
* Work 4-7 pm
* Dinner 7-8 pm
* Work 8-9 pm
* Relax 9-10 pm
* Bed 10:30

## Conflict Plan (Solo Developer)

### Conflict Resolution

* Describe your approach to resolving conflicts with yourself (e.g., disagreements in project direction).

Usually whenever I'm feeling overwhelmed with an issue, I take a walk or do some house chores to give my brain a break. Afterwards, depending on the conflict I will do some more research, ask ChatGPT for help, or reach out to a TA.

### Preventing Over-Dominance

* Ensure that you're not taking over the project entirely.
* Encourage a balanced approach to decision-making.

So this one might be one that doesn't directly apply to me, as I will be working at this on my own. But best thing I can come up with is to be open to feedback, and use tools to aid in the process rather than think it all needs to be done without help.

### Skill Level Variations

* Acknowledge any gaps in understanding and skill level.
* Plan how to address these gaps through self-learning or seeking external resources.

So my worst skill is probably CSS and UX/UI. My hope is to spend a little more time in the wireframing process, choosing a decent color palette, and really thinking about how I want the user to experience the website.

### Self-Reflection

* Consider how you will assess your own contributions objectively.
* Set criteria for when to adjust your approach if necessary.

I think the best thing I can do is get feedback throughout the entire process. The criteria will be if the feedback is based of user experience and will ensure a better experience to implement those changes. Things like color preferences or personal touch I will disregard as it is too subjective and beyond the scope of the assignment as I am not a designer, however I do appreciate a good design.

## Communication Plan (Solo Developer)

### Availability

* Define your available working hours for project-related tasks.

I have created a daily schedule up above.

### Communication Platforms

* Specify the communication tools you will use (e.g., Slack, email)

I will use Slack to discuss with a TA, Discord when chatting with friends.

### Breaks and Catching Up:

* Plan for short breaks during work hours.
* Outline your strategy for catching up if you fall behind schedule.

Breaks are also included in the above schedule. However, I do occasionally take stretch breaks, as I don't like sitting for too long. As for catching up, I try and do these assignments as if I were attending the in-person live classes. I have been able to keep that pace, other than the 2 week vacation I took.

### After-Hours Communication

* Decide how you will handle communication outside of regular work hours and on weekends

I will not be working late into the evening and jeopardizing my health and sleep.

### Ensuring Voice is Heard

* Set reminders to periodically review and reflect on your work.
* Encourage yourself to speak up when you have doubts or ideas.

When I am attending the classes, I journal my thoughts on how the day went. I will continue to do this for this assignment and add reflections on my work for the day.

### Creating a Safe Environment

* Acknowledge the importance of self-feedback.
* Strive to maintain a comfortable and productive working environment.

Best thing that helps me be in a good working environment is to have a clean space. I have been working in my office for my private practice and I keep that pretty clean and can stay focused without distractions.

## Work Plan (Solo Developer)

### Task Management

* Describe your strategy for identifying, assigning, and tracking tasks.

Current strategy is to employ the step by step guidelines that Code Fellows gives me for this assignment. From there I will do my best to execute the steps.

### Project Management Tool

* Specify the project management tool you'll use for organizing tasks (e.g., Trello, Jira).

I will be using Trello as the PM tool.

### Work Hours and Distribution

* Clearly define your work hours and stick to them.
* Ensure a balanced distribution of tasks throughout the project.

## Presentation Deck (Solo Developer)

### Create Presentation Deck

* Develop a presentation deck following the provided template.

[Link](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1NeXKKEpjK2DDme8EwlZBsJndUqIgGYzWrY6FAYtNTf0/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31)

### Practice Session

* Schedule a practice run with your instructor as a preparation for the actual presentation.

Don't know if I will actually be presenting or not, but I will do my best as if I am!

## Git Process (Solo Developer)

### GitHub Components

* Determine which parts of your project wil be hosted on GitHub.

Everything!

### Repository Sharing

* Decide how you'll manage and share your repository with yourself (branching, version control).

We were instructed to make 1 main branch, 1 development branch, and various feature branches.

### Git Workflow

* Define your Git workflow for solo coding tasks.

My workflow will consist of creating a new feature branch, writing code, testing, debugging, then pushing to the development branch. As the development branch begins to have multiple features that don't have any bugs I can push them into main. As I continue to create or update features, I will do so in the dev branch, that way the user doesn't experience the same bugs.
